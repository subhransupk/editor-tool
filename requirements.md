Users input their name.

The tool programmatically generates a handwritten-style signature (not using pre-made fonts).

The design is created dynamically with code (e.g., SVG paths, canvas drawing, or custom algorithms).

No external fonts or databases are used.


Takes user input (their name)
Allows users to choose a signature style
Generates a handwritten-looking signature
Uses custom algorithms/SVG paths/canvas drawing (not fonts)



Core Functionality:
Create a signature generator that produces handwritten-style signatures similar to your reference image
The signature should look natural and fluid, with smooth curves like the "Sadhyarahc" example shown
No pre-made fonts - everything will be generated using custom algorithms/SVG paths
Page Structure:
Create a dedicated page for the signature tool (not on homepage)
Layout will include:
Left sidebar: Ad space for future AdSense
Center: Main signature generator tool
Right sidebar: Ad space for future AdSense
Style Options (4 main categories):
Formal/Professional (clean, business-like signatures)
Casual/Modern (relaxed, contemporary look)
Artistic/Flourished (decorative with swashes like your reference)
Simple/Minimalist (straightforward, clean lines)
Output Format:
Download as PNG format
This will make it easy for users to use the signature in documents
Customization Options:
Signature size adjustment
Stroke thickness control
Slant angle adjustment
Color picker for signature color
Name Input Options:
Flexible name input where users can choose which parts to include:
First name
Middle name/initial
Last name
Users can select which parts they want in their signature
Technical Implementation:
Will use SVG paths and custom algorithms to generate the signatures
Each style will have its own algorithm for curve generation
Will implement smooth connections between letters
Will add natural variations in stroke width and flow
